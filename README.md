# Credence Frontend [![CI Status](https://github.com/CredenceOrg/Credence-Frontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CredenceOrg/Credence-Frontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Web UI for the Credence economic trust protocol. Connect a Stellar wallet, create or manage USDC bonds, and view trust scores.

## About

This app is part of [Credence](../README.md). It talks to the Credence backend API and (via wallet) to Soroban contracts on Stellar for bonding and attestations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). API requests to `/api` are proxied to the backend (default `http://localhost:3000`).

## Continuous Integration

Every pull request and push to the `main` branch is validated by a GitHub Actions workflow. The quality gate ensures that the code compiles, is correctly formatted, passes all linting rules, and that all tests pass:

- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test`

If any of these steps fail, the CI workflow will fail, and the PR cannot be merged until the issues are resolved.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when you need local link overrides:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The footer and legal links are resolved in `src/config/links.ts`. Use placeholder or canonical public URLs only; do not add secrets to Vite env files because `VITE_*` values are exposed to the browser build.

| Variable | Legacy alias | Default fallback | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| `VITE_DOCS_URL` | `VITE_DOCS` | `/docs` | Documentation link used in the footer. |
| `VITE_TERMS_URL` | `VITE_TERMS` | `/legal/terms` | Terms of Service link used in the footer. |
| `VITE_PRIVACY_URL` | `VITE_PRIVACY` | `/legal/privacy` | Privacy Policy link used in the footer. |

Precedence is `VITE_*_URL` first, then the legacy `VITE_*` alias, then the default fallback path. For example, `VITE_DOCS_URL` wins over `VITE_DOCS`; if neither is set, the app uses `/docs`.

The Vite dev server also proxies local API requests. Requests from the frontend to `/api` are forwarded to `http://localhost:3000` by `vite.config.ts`, so run the backend on port `3000` when testing API-backed flows locally.

The link variable intent and legal handoff notes are also tracked in `docs/footer-link-manifest.md`.

## Scripts

| Command   | Description          |
|----------|----------------------|
| `npm run dev`    | Start Vite dev server |
| `npm run build`  | TypeScript + production build |
| `npm run preview`| Preview production build |
| `npm run lint`   | Run ESLint |

## Tech

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router

## Project layout

- `src/pages/` — Home, Bond, Trust Score
- `src/components/` — Layout, shared UI
- `src/App.tsx` — Router and routes

To add wallet (e.g. Freighter) and contract calls, extend the Bond and Trust Score pages and add a small API client in `src/api/`.
